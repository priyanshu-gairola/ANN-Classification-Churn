# ANN-Classification-Churn

This project aims to predict customer churn using a deep learning approach with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built using TensorFlow. The trained model is integrated into an interactive Streamlit web application for easy deployment and user interaction.

Objective: Identify customers likely to leave (churn) based on behavioral and demographic data, enabling businesses to take proactive retention measures.

Model:
Built using TensorFlow with an ANN architecture optimized for binary classification.
Includes techniques like one hot encoding , label encodings.

Deployment:
The trained model is deployed in a user-friendly Streamlit app.
Users can input customer details directly through the app to get real-time churn predictions.

Features:
Intuitive Streamlit interface for predictions.
Scalable architecture for real-world deployment.

Technologies Used:
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the ANN model.
Pandas, NumPy: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
Streamlit: For deploying the app and creating an interactive user interface
